## MAGD-150
This is a repository of 5 projects that were completed for an **Intro to Media Arts and Game Development (MAGD)** class. 
The programs were written using the _Processing_ language and each one covers different basics of the _Processing_ language.

### Lab 6 - The Screensaver
For this assignment we had to create a screensaver. We were required to define and call three of our own functions. 
Also we had to define and construct an instance of one class. The code contains at least 4 single- or multi-line comments. 

I created a **star screensaver** that displays random colored stars around the screen with a rectangle at the top that disappears 
when half of the stars in the array have been displayed.

### Lab 7 - Nature Theme
For Lab 7, we were required to make a nature scene. It used _PVectors_ which help to animated the insect by making it walk across 
the screen. The sketch also includes some basic transformations like _translate, rotate and scale_ which were used to make the sun 
rotate and display the tree. The use of _rotate_ makes the sun move. The use of random, which displays the tree top in various 
locations, makes the tree seem to move. Comments are included to explain portions of the program.

### Lab 8 - Motivational Poster
The theme for this lab was to create a motivational poster. We had to create or load and display at least two fonts. 
Some text had to be animated or react to user input. There are some strings loaded from an external file. 

I created a poster about **Dyslexia** that had different sized fonts and one line of words spinning. 
Color was used to emphasize areas of the poster. The program allows the user to save the screen as a pdf by pressing s.

### Lab 9 - Documentary
The assignment was to create a documentary. We had to create, load and display at least one image and perform one transformation 
on the image. One video is loaded and played along with one sound file. For the sound, we had to use one of the effects or sound 
generation functions. 

The documentary I created is about **farming**. There is a picture of corn that I took and an video of me and my brother baling hay.

### Lab 10 - 3D sketch
Lab 10 was to create a 3D sketch that included creating a texture and applying it to 3D mesh. We had to create a 2D texture that 
is saved to a pdf. A few 3D shapes, lighting and a camera we also used in the sketch. The camera allows the viewer to see the 
sketch from all different angles.
