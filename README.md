## MAGD-150
This is a repository of 5 projects that were completed for an **Intro to Media Arts and Game Development (MAGD)** class. 
The programs were written using the _Processing_ language and each one covers different basics of the _Processing_ language.

### Lab 6 - The Screensaver
For this assignment we had to create a screensaver. We were required to define and call three of our own functions. 
Also we had to define and construct an instance of one class. The code contains at least 4 single- or multi-line comments. 

I created a **star screensaver** that displays random colored stars around the screen with a rectangle at the top that disappears 
when half of the stars in the array have been displayed.

### Lab 7 - Nature Theme
For Lab 7, we were required to make a nature scene. It used _PVectors_ which help to animated the insect by making it walk across 
the screen. The sketch also includes some basic transformations like _translate, rotate and scale_ which were used to make the sun 
rotate and display the tree. The use of _rotate_ makes the sun move. The use of _scale_ makes the tree seem to move. 
Comments are included to explain portions of the program.
